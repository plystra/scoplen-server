# Changelog

Changes are recorded here for released or reviewable repository outcomes.

## Unreleased

- Added an atomic SQLite sync retention pass that bounds history to the current version plus 20
  retained versions, purges acknowledged or 180-day-old tombstones, and advances the purge horizon
  without making membership or policy decisions in the storage layer.
- Added the SQLite sync storage foundation: per-vault gap-free sequences, atomic compare-and-swap
  batches, current change and snapshot paging, acknowledgement cursors, and bounded version reads.
- Added the server workspace baseline, role/configuration boundary, first-run material, public
  listener, ALPN declaration, health endpoints, structured logging, and TypeScript console checks.
