# Server architecture

`spl-server` is a single process with role selection. The role names are `api`, `worker`, `ca`,
`edge`, and `gateway`; `all` expands to those roles in a stable order. The process loads one TOML
configuration, applies non-empty `SPL_` environment overrides, and validates local invariants.
It creates first-run material when a database-backed role is selected, then starts the selected
roles. Standalone `ca` and `gateway` roles do not open SQLite or create Personal setup material.

The public listener is one TCP port. In `plain` mode it is intended to sit behind a trusted TLS
terminator. In `files` mode it terminates TLS itself and advertises `h2`, `http/1.1`, and
`spl-gw/1` through ALPN. In `acme` mode it obtains and renews a certificate through Let's Encrypt
TLS-ALPN-01, persists the ACME account and certificate cache below the data directory, and uses
the same ALPN set for application connections. The gateway protocol is reserved for the managed
data-path gate and is not accepted by the baseline listener yet.

The baseline exposes `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics`. Logs are JSON tracing events; secret
material is written only under the configured data directory and is never included in request
responses or logs.

The relational storage boundary currently supports SQLite only for `api`, `worker`, and `edge`.
Those roles open `server.data_dir/scoplen.sqlite`, enable WAL and foreign keys on pooled
connections, and apply embedded forward migrations before generating first-run material. The
migrations establish the organization table plus the sync storage foundation: vault counters,
current opaque object envelopes, retained version rows, per-device acknowledgement cursors, and
the account key-bundle tables. Account key artifacts remain opaque at this boundary; the store
scopes wrapped-ARK reads to the authenticated device and applies atomic revision replay rules.
`scoplen-store` allocates a contiguous sequence range inside a write transaction, checks every
compare-and-swap base before changing state, and exposes current change and full-reconciliation
snapshot pages without interpreting envelope bytes. A migration error prevents those roles from
starting. `/readyz` queries the database and returns 503 when the query fails. Public HTTP/auth
endpoints are still unmounted by the baseline listener; the injected sync router now covers the
account-key, object-sync, and local notification boundaries but still delegates authentication,
signature verification, membership, and policy decisions to the service. Notification events are
encoded by `scoplen-api` and delivered only to authenticated device subscriptions through a
process-local broadcast hub. A parallel PostgreSQL migration set is checked against the SQLite
logical schema in tests; PostgreSQL `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` fan-out and event publication from the
identity and vault services remain open. `scoplen-store` also exposes a backend-neutral object
storage boundary for local filesystem and S3-compatible stores, with validated keys and streaming
or multipart access. Database-backed roles initialize the configured object backend at startup and
`/readyz` checks its reachability alongside the relational database. The durable job queue stores
bounded opaque payloads, claims jobs with owner-checked leases, records retries, and requeues
expired leases; the `worker` role runs this cleanup from a 30-second heartbeat. Policy filtering,
retention job scheduling and membership-aware tombstone purge orchestration, the PostgreSQL query
backend and runtime role selection, application-level column encryption, audit, and other worker
jobs remain roadmap work.
